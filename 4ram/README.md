# RAM
Trying to build a 6502 based computer. 

One could argue that the [previous](../3eeprom/README.md) chapter resulted in a real computer: 
oscillator, CPU, EEPROM with a running program. The problem is that the only (RAM) memory the 
program used was the (A, X and Y) registers.

In this chapter we will add RAM.
But it is time to understand ... time.
Timing of the 6502 and memories.
