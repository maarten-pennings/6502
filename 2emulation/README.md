# Emulation
Trying to build a 6502 based computer.

We have (see [previous chapter](..\1clock)) a 6502 in free run: it executes NOP, NOP, NOP, ... and by inspecting
the address lines (either having LEDs on the high lines, or using the scope on the low lines) we observe the addresses change.

But are we sure the 6502 is doing what we expect? Is it really starting at address EAEA (the reset vector at FFFC and FFFD also 
reads EA and EA) and then progressing to EAEB, EAEC? Would be nice if we can check that. 

Then I had a nice idea: the Nano controls the clock, so it knows when the address bus is valid, can't the Nano snoop it?
Can't we snoop (read) the data bus as well? Can't we _write_ the data bus? Yes, yes, and yes.

## Clock

The [first step](https://github.com/maarten-pennings/6502/tree/master/1clock#clock---nano---wiring) was taken in the 
previous chapter. We used a Nano as a clock source for the 6502. The address lines are dangling, the data lines are hardwired to EA 
(the opcode of the NOP instruction). We had a very simple sketch that flips the clock line, and behold we had a 6502 
"free" running at 160kHz.

## Address bus

With the first experiment, we believe the 6502 is executing NOPs. Can we check that? Can we check that it starts at EAEA 
(the reset vector at FFFC and FFFD also reads EA and EA) and then progressing to EAEB, EAEC? Can we spy the address bus?

Since the Nano generates the clock, we know when we have to sample the address bus.
Does the Nano have enough inputs? It seems to have D0..D13 so 14 lines.
However D0 and D1 [double](https://www.theengineeringprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/introduction-to-arduino-nano-13-1.png) 
as RXD and TXD and we need those two pins to send the trace to the PC (over USB). That leaves us with 12 lines, where 16 would be nice.
From the [pinout](https://www.theengineeringprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/introduction-to-arduino-nano-13-1.png)
we see that analog pins A0..A5 also have a double role, they can act as digital pins. That's 6 more digital pins. 

In other words, we have 18 digital pins. We need 1 for clock and 16 far the address lines. Even one spare.

![Schematic of Nano spying on the address lines](nano-address.png)

The schematics above looks like this on my breadboard:

![Board of Nano spying on the address lines](nano-address.jpg)

The program on the Nano, [AddrSpy6502](addrspy6502) is simple. The `loop()` pulses the clock, 
reads all 16 address lines and prints them out in hex (with a time stamp).
```
void loop() {
  // Send clock low
  digitalWrite(PIN_CLOCK, LOW);
  // Send clock high again
  digitalWrite(PIN_CLOCK, HIGH);
  
  // Read address bus
  uint16_t addr=0 ;
  addr += digitalRead(PIN_ADDR_0 ) << 0;
  addr += digitalRead(PIN_ADDR_1 ) << 1;
  ...
  addr += digitalRead(PIN_ADDR_15) << 15;

  // Print address bus
  char buf[32];
  sprintf(buf,"%9ldus %04x",micros(),addr);
  Serial.println(buf);
}
```

This is the experiment I did.
- I pressed the reset button of the Nano down, and with the same hand I pressed the reset button of the 6502 down.
- I cleared the output of the Arduino terminal
- I released the reset of the Nano.
- As soon as I saw the first output of the Nano, I released the reset of the 6502.
- I disabled autoscroll in the terminal and copied the trace.

This was the trace (I manually added the `<- reset released`)

```

Note that the first ~400 000 us of the Nano trace, the 6502 was still in reset.
It had a random pattern on the address bus, in this case 3586 (hex).
Just before 409908us I released the reset of the 6502 (you can't see that, it's my guess).

What we see on the address bus can be found in the 6502 datasheet, but is also very well explained
on the [6502.org site](http://www.6502.org/tutorials/interrupts.html#1.3):

```
                 // 6502 reset released
   409908us 3586 // first internal administrative operation of 6502
   411440us 3586 // second internal operation
   412968us 01ee // push of return address (PCH) on stack, decrement stack pointer (note S is EE)
   414500us 01ed // push the return address (PCL) on stack, decrement stack pointer (note S is ED)
   416028us 01ec // push the processor status register (P) on stack, decrement stack pointer (note S is EC)
   417556us fffc // get PCL from reset vector (FFFC), presumably reads EA
   419088us fffd // get PCH from reset vector (FFFD), presumably reads EA
   420620us eaea // Jump to reset vector, indeed EAEA. Executes first instruction (NOP)
   422148us eaeb // Executes 2nd instruction (NOP)
   423680us eaeb // Executes 2nd instruction (NOP)
   425208us eaec // Executes 3rd instruction (NOP)
   426740us eaec // Executes 3rd instruction (NOP)
```

Some notes
 - All three interrupts, NMI with vector at FFFA, RESET with vector at FFFC and IRQ with vector at FFFE
   have the same 7-clock interrupt sequence. 
 - One exception: for RESET the three pushes are fake: the 6502 issues a _read_ to the memory instead of a _write_.
 - The stack pointer (S) has a random value after reset, in the above run it happened to be EE.
   The stack page is hardwired to 01 on the 6502.
 - A NOP is two cycles, and we see that after RESET the address bus indeed changes every other step.
 - I can not explain why the first NOP only takes one clock.
 - The time between the trace lines (one clock period) is about 1500us, so we are running at 0.7kHz


## Jump loop

The previous experiment is a success: we see the address lines increment nicely (in steps of two)
and also the reset behavior is as documented. Still, it would be nice to have a more realistic program;
a series of NOPs is not very convincing.

However, without a memory to store our program, we are limited in our possibilities.
There is one way out: go old style. Write a program in _hardware_.

I got the idea from [James Calvert's tight loop](http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/6504.htm).
We make some logic that emulates an 8 byte program.
We NOR together the first three address lines to create the "v-signal".
The v-signal is bound to D2, D3 and D6, the other data lines (D0, D1, D4, D5 and D7) are bound to GND.
So, the data bus is 0b 0v00 vv00. This means that 
 - if v=0 then D = 0b 0000 0000 = 0x00
 - if v=1 then D = 0b 0100 1100 = 0x4C

For the various addresses, that gives the following data reads:

  | address (hex) | address (bin) | v-signal| data |
  |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------:|:----:|
  |     ...       |       ...     |         |      |
  |     FFFC      |    ... 100    |    0    |  00  | 
  |     FFFD      |    ... 101    |    0    |  00  |
  |     FFFE      |    ... 110    |    0    |  00  |
  |     FFFF      |    ... 111    |    0    |  00  |
  |     0000      |    ... 000    |    1    |  4C  |
  |     0001      |    ... 001    |    0    |  00  |
  |     0002      |    ... 010    |    0    |  00  |
  |     0003      |    ... 011    |    0    |  00  |
  |     ...       |       ...     |         |      |

In other words, at FFFC, the 6502 reads the start address 00 00, and at 0000 the 6502 reads 4C 00 00.
Note that 4C 00 00 means JMP 0000, since 4C is the opcode for JMP abs.

This the schematic

Here is a photo of my board. Note the _triple OR_ (4075) and the _hex inverter_ (7404) chips on the right.
Also note the three blue wires coming in (from A0, A1, A2) and the blue wire going out (to D2, d3 and D6).

![nano-jmp.jpg](nano-jmp.jpg)

With the same [sketch](addrspy6502) as the previous experiment, let's make a trace again.
We repeat our manual steps: Nano reset down, 6502 reset down, Nano reset up, wait for output, 6502 reset up.
This is the trace (I manually added the `<- reset released`)

Some notes
 - Before 270680us the reset is released (can't see that from the trace). 
 - We see the two internal administrative operations
 - We see the (fake) push of PCH, PCL, P.
   The stack pointer S now starts at FA, so pushes to 01FA, 01F9 and 01F8.
 - We see the reset vector load (FFFC, FFFD)
 - We see the load of 0000 (this confirms that FFFC and FFFD read 00 00)
 - We see the load of 0001, 0002
 - We see the load of 0000 again, which hints that JMP 0000 was executed
 - One clock is still about 1500us (0.7kHz)


## Data bus

In the notes on the previous experiment, we have "load of 0000 again, which hints that JMP 0000 was executed".
Wouldn't it be nice if we could not only see the address bus, but also the data bus?
We can, but we loose details on the address bus.

Recall that we have Nano D2 for the 6502 Ï•0 (clock), and Nano D4..D13 plus A0..A5 for 6502 A0..A15.
This leaves Nano D3, A6 and A7 free.
Let's redesign.

 - Connect Nano D3 to R6502 R/nW so that we can trace if the 6502 did a read or a write on the data bus.
 - Use Nano D4..D11 for 6502 data bus D0..D7. Full data trace.
 - Use Nano D12, D13, A0..A7 for 6502 A0..A9. Thus 10 bit address trace.

There is one problem: Nano A6 and A7 are analog only.
We cannot use `digitalRead()` on those pins.
We can however read them in an analog fashion by using `analogRead()` and comparing the result with half the 
maximum analog readout: 1024/2.
The drawback is that `analogRead()` is [slow](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogread/):

> On ATmega based boards (UNO, Nano, Mini, Mega), it takes about 100 microseconds (0.0001 s) 
> to read an analog input, so the maximum reading rate is about 10,000 times a second.

We prefer to use 10 bits, because this means we have 4 pages (an 6502 page is 256 bytes):
 - page 0, for well, zero-page addressing of the 6502
 - page 1, for the stack
 - page 2, for the code
 - page 3, for the interrupt vectors

 - The leading nibble of the address is always 0 (we only capture 10 bits).
 - The second nible of the address bus is only 0, 1, 2 or 3 (we only capture 2 bits in this nibble).
 - All bytes are read as 00 except at location 0000, there it reads 4C.
 - The three push instructions (01fd, 01fc, 01fb) are indeed fake: they read instead of write (R/nW flag is 1).
 - One clock is now about 2000us (0.5kHz).



## Emulate ROM

 - Now also emulate rom (loop with inx and stx)
 - Add irq and isr

## Emulate RAM

 - Now also support data write
